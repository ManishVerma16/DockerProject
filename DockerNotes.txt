04/04/2020 session 5
The session was good and I learned so many new things like:
1. understand the internal strucutre of docker, how it uses hardware and redhat kernel(base OS) and how it works with the help of all these thing.
2. understand that we put only those software which are required for services in container.
3. learned about docker nics other than enp0s3 and how IP forwarding works in docker and redhat and how routing is used for connecting docker with external internet.

5. learned about Docker proxy which manages the router.
6. learned about storage and its two types: framral(empheral) and persistence and what are the difference between these two storages.
7. understand the concept of framral and persistence with lots of examples and performed lots of practicals to understand the concept in deep-dive.
8. we learned about the persistence storage using volume option in docker and create an external safe storage which helps a lot in case of some type of system failures and major issues.
9. understand how to set up local yum for software installation in docker and use it to install httpd webserver without using internet.

12/04/2020 session 6
The session was good and I learned so many new things like:
1. we created a project based on Wordpress and mysql which is a blog or article site and its deployment over docker.
2. we understand about mutli-tier architecture which is a good concept and highly used in today's real world situation.
3. in multi-tier architecture we use containers running on different os and linked them in such a way that the work as a whole new dependent containers. we used wordpress and mysql for this puprose.
4. we understand about mysql service, install it, setup it, and launch it for storing the data generated through wordpress into its data base.
5. we used wordpress for making a whole new front-end of our project and customise its look and feel according to our convenience and connected it with mysql database.
6. we use almost all the concept we have learnt in previous docker class like: we use PATting, linking(DNS) from networking, apache-php webserver, volumes to store the webpages and database, and some concept of yaml language for coding.
7. we learnt about an important concept called IAAC or Infrastructure as a Code which is nothing but making a program file which consist whole infrastructure and we can launch it using a one command in one second.
8. for managing the Infrasturcture in docker we need to use docker-compose which is generally a .yml file written in .yaml programming language and everything in this language is stored inside in key-value pair format.
9. we learn how to understand and rectify the error coming in launching the project and also understand about entrypoint in docker containers and how the work in multi-tier architecture.
and many more things...
Your work is highly appreciated.
